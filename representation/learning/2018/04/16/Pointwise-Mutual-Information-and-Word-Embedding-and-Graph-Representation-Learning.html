<p>One important question in machine learning is to represent effectively complex objects in computationally tractable approach. Common procedures are to assign these objects some vectors in a finite dimensional vector space, taking advantage of the geometric structure of the vector space.</p>

<p>​	Examples include: words, sentences, documents in NLP; vertices in graphs; images; etc… In machine learning, people call it “embedding”: word embedding, graph embedding. We call such assignment of vectors is called “embedding”. Formally, given a set of objects \(\mathcal{O}\), the embedding is a mapping \(\Phi:\mathcal{O}\rightarrow \mathcal{R}^d\).</p>

<p>​	This is a summary of two representation algorithms: word2vec, which learns word embedding, and Deep2walk, which learns embedding for vertices in a social network.</p>

<h1 id="word2vec-and-pointwise-mutual-information">Word2vec and Pointwise Mutual Information</h1>

<p>​	For details of word2vec, please refer to <a href="http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/">this tutorial</a>. We analyze the skip-gram model which is recommended by Mikolov et al., the authors of the original paper of word2vec.</p>

<p>​	Suppose the vocabulary is \(V\). Each word in \(V\) has a dual identity: it can be a word per se, or the <em>context</em> of some other word. We denote the set of words by \(V_W\) and context by \(V_C\). A popular approach of sampling word-context pairs is to define the context of \(w\) as words which appear surrounding \(w\); we denote the collection of words and context pairs as \(D\).</p>

<p>​	Word2vec gives each word two vector representations: one is for the word per se, and the other for the word as a context. That is to say, for each word \(w\in V_W\), its representation is \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathcal{R}^d\), and for \(c\in V_C\), we have \(\mathbf{c}\in\mathbf{R}^d\).</p>

<p>​	To learn the embedding, word2vec parameterized the occurrence of a word-context pair:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P((w,c)\in D) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{c})</script>
