Intro
---------
I'm a junior undergraduate of Zhejiang University interested in network mining, data science and statistical learning theory. Currenly I'm working as a research intern in [DCD](http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/) Lab (Digital media Computing & Design Lab), Zhejiang University, under the guidance of [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/).
I'm planning to extend my study by applying for a PhD program next year and I am majorly interested in machine learning/data mining/statistics programs.

Research Interests
----------
- Representation learning of networks
- Social network mining
- Statistical learning theories
- Geometric view of machine learning

Research Projects
----------
**Task-specific representation learning of heterogeneous networks**

*Joint work with Yang Yang, Yuhong Xu and Lekui Zhou*

- Study of designing representation learning which maximizes efficiency in specific tasks. 
- We are also expected to incorporate community embedding and representation learning at the graph level. 

**Non-disriminative representation learning**

*Joint work with Yang Yang and Zhanlin Sun*
- Study of mapping attributes to a latent feature space based on which machine learning algorithms leads to fair decision making process on potentially biased historical data set.
- Proposed a min-max adversarial gaming framework to incorporate de-biasing in the process of representation learning. 

**Representation Learning of Scale-free Networks**

*Joint work with Yang Yang and Wenjie Hu*

- Theoretically analyzed the feasibility of embedding scale-free networks onto Euclidean space using tools of the sphere packing analysis. 
- Proposed *degree-punishment principle* to optimize the embedding efficiency of scale-free networks, by measuring the preservation of the scale-free property.
- Our principle is able to significantly improve efficiency of representation vectors in various network mining tasks.

As illustrated in the figure below, the scale-free property of complex networks can hardly be preserved in low-dimensional Euclidean space.

Applying the principle improves the representation vector's ability to reconstruct a scale-free network.
